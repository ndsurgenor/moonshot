# moonshot
_Please note that this README file outlines the frontend development of this application; if you require info on backend development please navigate to [the README for moonshot-api](https://github.com/ndsurgenor/moonshot-api/blob/main/README.md)_

Moonshot (stylised completely in lowercase) is a web application built for the sharing and discussion around amateur astrophotography. This site has been designed to allow imagined users and visitors the ability to view photos uploaded by registered users of the site; registered users will also be able to create a personal profile and 'star' (that is, like) and comment on other users' posts.

## UX Design

The site is aimed at helping users to easily upload their personal photos of the night sky alongside relevant info such as what the photo shows, where/when it was taken, and what equipment was used. It also aims to give users the ability to view, star, and comment on the photos uploaded by other users of the site.

## Strategy

### Milestones & User Stories
This project was developed with 6 milestones (epics) in mind. From each of these milestones a number of dev goals and user stories were created, each one given a prioritisation using the MoSCoW method. The detail of these milestones, goals, and stories implemented in the final project is outlined below; further detail regarding sprints, MoSCoW designation and acceptance criteria (covered under Structure) are included on the [GitHub Projects Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/ndsurgenor/projects/9) created for the project.

![Kanban](docs/kanban.png)

## Skeleton

### Wireframe Models
Now that specific features had been decided upon, a wireframing tool was used to give guidance as to how these features would look in practice. All of the site-design models which follow can be viewed on one page [using the following link](https://cacoo.com/diagrams/0fnnxvmLc5f5SWHK/D61AD)

### Logged-Out Pages
- Home (logged-out)
- Sign Up
- Sign In

![Sign-Up](docs/wf-signup.png)
![Sign-In](docs/wf-signin.png)

### Logged-In Pages
- Home (logged-in)
- Upload
- Photo Detail
- Profile
- Gear/Account Forms

![Home-User](docs/wf-home-user.png)
![Upload](docs/wf-upload-form.png)

![Profile-edit](docs/wf-profile-edit.png)

## Surface

With wireframe and database models in place, actual features of the site could now be coded using HTML, Bootstrap for ReactJS, CSS, and JavaScript JSX & React, all according to the criteria listed above.

### Design & Typography
  - [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) was chosen as the font for h1 and h2 elements throughout the site to give a refined, rounded look to major headings
  - All other text on the site is styled using [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Barlow) to provide a minimalist, narrower-styled contrast to the headings and be clearly legible for larger portions of text
  - The main colours selected for the site were chosen as reflection of elements often associated with space and the sky, but choosing in favour of deep blues over black to provide a nicer contrast for users. Specifically these colours and their hexadecimal codes are:
    - Oxford Blue variant #05162E
    - Gunmetal Green variant #0C2A33
    - Goldenrod #DAA520
    - Whitesmoke #F5F5F5
    - Dim Grey #696969  
  - The site logo was chosen as an abstract representation of the moon, while a full-moon icon along with a single 'm' is used as the favicon for the site. 

  ![Design](docs/design.png)

### Features & Components Implemented

Each of the following implementations was added in response to the user stories and acceptance criteria above, details of which are provided below each feature heading for easy reference.

![Home](docs/fts-home.png)

- Signed-out users will see a welcome message displayed as the page's header
- Signed-in users will see feed filters and a description as the page's header
- Both views use the adaptable Photo Feed page which can be called with different filters for different views
- Anytime the photo feed is called it displays using a responsive 'masonry' layout and infinite scroll component
- The reusable Asset component is called while photos are loading in the form of a 'loading-dot' animation along with text of 'Loading images...' 
- The Photo Feed page also renders a search bar just below the page header
- Further filtering is achieved with the Filters component in the signed-in view
- Each photo is rendered using a reusable Photo Card component which allows for the adding of stars and access to individual user profiles
- Each photo can be clicked directly to direct the user to an individual page for the image outlining photo details (see [Photo Details](#photo-details) below)

#### Sign Up/In

- If the photo belongs to the sign-in user, 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons will also appear above the image
- Selecting 'Edit' redirects the user to the relevant form with pre-populated fields for the photo
- Selecting 'Delete' will display a confirmation modal to help prevent accidental deletion

#### Photo Comments
> &bull; 6.2 User Story: as a Site User I want to be able to comment on other users photos so that I can ask questions and/or start a discussion about the photo

![PhotoComments](docs/fts-photo-comments.png)

- The reusable Comment component renders a comment form and all user comments below the related image
- Clicking the 'add' button is not possible until text has actually been added to the form
- Adding a comment causes a Comment component with the relevant info to immediately display below the Add Comment form
- Comments are displayed with the reusable Avatar component allowing access to that user's profile
- Clicking 'Edit' below an owned comment caused the form to render in place so changes can be made

#### Profile
> &bull; 5.5 - User Story: as a Site User I want to be able to access a personalised profile page so that I can add an avatar, personal bio and equipment details 

![Profile](docs/fts-profile.png)

- A profile specific avatar is displayed using the reusable Avatar component
- Personal and equipment details of the particular user are also displayed as a header
- As with the home page above, a filtered photo feed (specific to the displayed user) is used to render the rest of the page
- The reusable Asset component is called while photos are loading in the form of a 'loading-dot' animation along with text of 'Loading images...' 
- As before, each photo is rendered using a reusable Photo Card component which allows for the adding of stars and access to an individual page for the image outlining details (see [Photo Details](#photo-details) above)

#### Gear/Account Detail Forms
> &bull; 5.5 - User Story: as a Site User I want to be able to access a personalised profile page so that I can add an avatar, personal bio and equipment details  

![GearAccount](docs/fts-gear-account.png)

- Gear form allows user to set their favoured lens and camera along with any other equipment
- Gear info set using this form is displayed on the user's profile and auto-filled in the upload form
- Account form allows user to update personal image in reusable Avatar component as well as name and personal details
- Account info set reusing this form is displayed on the user's profile
- Stylised success/error messages ('toasts') appear on clicking 'Save' to provide immediate feedback from the form to the user
- Field specific alerts let the user know of any specific issue with the data they have entered 

#### 404 Error Page

![404](docs/fts-404.png)

- The 404 page displays when the user tries to access a non-existent page
- This page uses the reusable Asset component to display the no-results.png image alongside info text

### Features to be implemented

The following features have been identified as long-term goals which bring value to the UX; however, they have not been implemented at this stage as they would require a significant time investment, thereby delaying vital other features of the site, or a level of programming knowledge which I haven't yet developed. 

- Following/unfollowing other users: requires a new model at the backend and extensive work on the frontend which was not within the time capabilities of the initial project
