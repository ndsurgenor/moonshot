# moonshot

Moonshot (stylised completely in lowercase) is a web application built for the sharing and discussion around amateur astrophtography. 

This site has been designed to allow imagined users and visitors the ability to view photos uploaded by registered users of the site; registered users will also be able to create a personal profile and 'star' (that is, like) and comment on other users' posts.

## UX Design

The site is aimed at helping users to easily upload their personal photos of the nightsky alongside relevant info such as what the photo shows, where/when it was taken, and what equipment was used. It also aims to give users the ability to view, star, and comment on the photos uploaded by other users of the site.

## Strategy

### Milestones & User Stories
This project was developed with 6 milestones (epics) in mind. From each of these milestones a number of dev goals and user stories were created, each one given a prioritisation using the MoSCoW method. The detail of these milestones, goals, and stories implemented in the final project is outlined below; further detail regarding sprints, MoSCoW designation and acceptance criteria (covered under Structure) are included on the [GitHub Projects Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/ndsurgenor/projects/9) created for the project.

## Structure

With Strategy and Scope now in place, focus shifted to setting acceptance criteria for each of the above, thereby informing exactly what features to include as part of the project. These acceptance criteria were added to each Dev Goal and User Story on the aforementioned Kanban board to act as an insurance that task would be completed to the fullest extent needed.

## Skeleton

### Wireframe Models
Now that specific features had been decided upon, a wireframing tool was used to give guidance as to how these features would look in practice. All of the site-design models which follow can be viewed on one page [using the following link](https://cacoo.com/diagrams/0fnnxvmLc5f5SWHK/D61AD)

### Logged-Out Pages
- Home (logged-out)
- Sign Up
- Sign In

![Home-Intial](docs/wf-home-initial.png)
![Sign-Up](docs/wf-signup.png)
![Sign-In](docs/wf-signin.png)

### Logged-In Pages
- Home (logged-in)
- Upload
- Photo Detail
- Profile
- Gear/Account Forms

![Home-User](docs/wf-home-user.png)
![Upload](docs/wf-upload-form.png)
![Photo-Detail](docs/wf-photo-detail.png)
![Profile](docs/wf-user-profile.png)
![Profile-edit](docs/wf-profile-edit.png)

<!-- ### Database Model
!!! MOVE THIS TO API README !!!

The [database model](TO BE ADDED) was designed on the basis of django-allauth handling data for authorised users, while the booking model would be coded by myself. The diagram below shows the relationship of various tables within the project, but central to this is the relationship between the 'auth_user' and 'booking_sys_booking' tables; specifically, a one-to-many by connection of the user_id and contact_id fields i.e. a single user can create many bookings, but each booking can only belong to one user.

![Database](TO BE ADDED) -->

## Surface

With wireframe and database models in place, actual features of the site could now be coded using HTML, Bootstrap for ReactJS, CSS, and JavaScript JSX & React, all according to the criteria listed above.

### Design & Typography
  - [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) was chosen as the font for h1 and h2 elements throughout the site to give a refined, rounded look to major headings
  - All other text on the site is styled using [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Barlow) to provide a minimalist, narrower-styled contrast to the headings and be clearly legible for larger portions of text
  - The main colours selected for the site were chosen as reflection of elements often associated with space and the sky, but choosing in favour of deep blues over black to provide a nicer contrast for users. Specifically these colours and their hexadecimal codes are:
    - Oxford Blue variant #05162E
    - Gunmetal Green variant #0C2A33
    - Goldenrod #DAA520
    - Whitesmoke #F5F5F5
    - Dim Grey #696969  
  - The site logo was chosen as an abstract representation of the moon, while a full-moon icon along with a single 'm' is used as the favicon for the site. 

  ![Design](docs/design.png)

![Home](docs/fts-home.png)

- Signed-out users will see a welcome message displayed as the page's header
- Signed-in users will see feed filters and a desciption as the page's header
- Both views use the adaptible Photo Feed page which can be called with different filters for different views
- Anytime the photo feed is called it displays using a reponsive 'masonry' layout and infinite scroll component
- The reusable Asset component is called while photos are loading in the form of a 'loading-dot' animation along with text of 'Loading images...' 
- The Photo Feed page also renders a search bar just below the page header
- Further filtering is achieved with the Filters component in the signed-in view
- Each photo is rendered using a reusable Photo Card component which allows for the adding of stars and access to individual user profiles

### Features to be implemented

The following features have been identified as long-term goals which bring value to the UX; however, they have not been implemented at this stage as they would require a significant time investment, thereby delaying vital other features of the site, or a level of programming knowledge which I haven't yet developed. 

- Following/unfollowing other users: requires a new model at the backend and extensive work on the frontend which was not within the time capabilities of the initial project

  11. Open 'settings.py' and add the following near the top of the code:
      ```python
      import os
      import dj_database_url
      if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
        import env
      ```
  12. Further down the page, replace any current instance of the SECRET_KEY variable with:
      ``` python
      SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
      ```
  13. Replace the DATABASES variable with
      ```python
      DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
        }
      ```
